# Benchmark report of the [HILARy paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.22.521661)

There are three uses of HILARy mentionned in the article.

1. On Briney real data. This concerns figure 5 of the article. The script used to generate the figure is `HILARy/benchmark/scripts/figure5.ipynb`. The philogenies inferred with HILARy are obtained using `HILARy/tutorial.ipynb`, but are also available on [zenondo](https://zenodo.org/records/10676371?preview=1).

2. On the dataset used in article [Inference of B cell clonal families using heavy/light chain pairing information](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010723). The complete benchmark procedure is explained in `HILARy/benchmark/partis_dataset/README.md`. The code used to create figure 4 is `HILARy/benchmark/scripts/figure4_partis.ipynb`

3. On synthetic data.
